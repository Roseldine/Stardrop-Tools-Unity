# Stardrop Tools for Unity
Unity Framework that compiles a set of base scripts, tools & prefabs that accelerate the Unity workflow from Idea/Prototype to AAA game.
This is an ever expanding framework that I use in all my projects.

Its foundation is on the Observer Pattern, but in reality it is a mix of Singleton x Observer Pattern.

LookManager
Singletons (Scriptable Object Singleton)
Events
State Machines
Tween System (expanding as needed)
Random Generation (WIP)

BaseComponent
BaseObject
BaseUIObject

UI Menus
UI Toggles
Simplified Animation Transitions

Grids (WIP)

This framework works heavily with components.
