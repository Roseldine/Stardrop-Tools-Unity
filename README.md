# Stardrop Tools for Unity
Unity Framework that compiles a set of base scripts, tools & prefabs that accelerate the Unity workflow from Idea/Prototype to AAA game.
This is an ever expanding framework that I use in all my projects.
<br>
Its foundation is on the Observer Pattern, but in reality it is a mix of Singleton x Observer Pattern.

<br>

* LoopManager
* Singletons (Scriptable Object Singleton)
* Events
* State Machines
* Tween System (expanding as needed)
* Random Generation (WIP)

<br>

* BaseComponent
* BaseObject
* BaseUIObject

<br>

* UI Menus
* UI Toggles
* Simplified Animation Transitions

<br>

This framework works heavily with components.
